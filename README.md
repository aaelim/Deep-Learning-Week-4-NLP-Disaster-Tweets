# Deep-Learning-Week-4-NLP-Disaster-Tweets

natlang.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook and the best to visualize for peer grading. NLP Disasters Report is in pdf format for those that prefer this over a Jupyter notebook (download for higher quality visualization). To run, all files need to be included in the relevant folders, all libraries need to be installed, and the Kaggle dataset (not included) needs to be downloaded. Generatd files such as best.pt and submission.csv are not included but can be obtained by fully running the notebook.
